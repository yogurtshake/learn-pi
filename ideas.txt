extremely simple PWA

-have reference popup containing ~1000 digits of pi
-have user enter as many digits as they know, stop them (buzz? flash red?) when they enter an incorrect digit, but let them keep going after they correct it
-have a "reveal next digit" button and don't allow them to continue once this is clicked, 
but instead give a restart button
